# The Toeplitz Project Literature Library

This is a collection of Proofscape modules, representing proofs from historical
mathematical literature.


## What's in the library

The library should encompass works by mathematicians
like those apt to be listed under the [MacTutor](https://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/)
biographies. It should cover classic works of historical significance.

In terms of Proofscape concepts, the modules in this library contain
only deductions (no annotations). These deductions
represent only theorems and proofs from the literature (no expansions).

However, it is appropriate to record comparisons, linking the nodes in this
library.  These are akin to the editorial footnotes or cross-references often
found in collected works.


## Enrichments

Enrichments can be contributed in other project repos:

* [gh.toepproj.ex](https://github.com/toepproj/ex): expansions and example
  explorers
* [gh.toepproj.en](https://github.com/toepproj/en): English translations


## How to contribute

Contributions are made by forking this repository, adding or improving
modules, and making a pull request. Please be sure to read

Proofscape modules can be developed using
[PISE](https://proofscape.org/download/pise.html),
the Proofscape Integrated Study Environment.
